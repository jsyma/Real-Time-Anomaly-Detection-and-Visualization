## Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Visualization 

**This Python-based tool features**: 
- **Data Generation**: Uses NumPy to generate synthetic data in a sine wave pattern with added random noise and occasional anomalies.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements a moving average-based anomaly detection algorithm using NumPy, identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected trend and marking them as anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Provides both a static and real-time animated visualizations using matplotlib to display the data stream, moving average and detected anomalies.
